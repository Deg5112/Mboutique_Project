This was the first Project of LearningFuze bootcamp. 

The idea was to code out and emulate a small business website, after being given the wireframe from a design team. 

Initially this took quite a bit of time. After going back through this and iterating over it again in bootstrap later on in the course, it only took a couple of hours. Then, I went back and practiced angular routing on this as well, made it mobile responsive, and added a little bit of javascript to allow a language translation feature, with google's translate api.
